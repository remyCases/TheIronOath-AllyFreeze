# The Iron Oath - AllyFreeze

## Description

FrozenTomb will always work on allies even if they have the `Immunity` buff or `Mind Over Matter` passive.

## Installation

This mod was made with `BepInEx` which is why you need to install it first.

### Installing BepInEx

- Download the version `5.4.22` of [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.22).
- Unzip it in the `The Iron Oath` folder.

### Installing BiggerTeam

- Download the latest release of [AllyFreeze](https://github.com/remyCases/TheIronOath-AllyFreeze/releases). 
- Move it in the `The Iron Oath/BepInEx/plugins` folder.

You can now play the game with the modded version !

## Troubleshooting

## For anyone who wants to change this mod and build it themself

> [!CAUTION]
> The current repo can not be built directly as I didn't include the `Assembly dll` of The Iron Oath (for obvious reasons).
> You need to create a `lib` folder first and to move the `Assembly-CSharp.dll` from the `The Iron Oath/The Iron Oath_Data/Managed` folder to the `lib` folder.

This mod was made using `HarmonyX`, a fork of `Harmony2` from `BepInEx`. I strongly advise anyone who wants to change the mod to check the documentation of [Harnomy2](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/intro.html) and to check the difference between [Harmony2 and HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX/wiki/Difference-between-Harmony-and-HarmonyX) first.
